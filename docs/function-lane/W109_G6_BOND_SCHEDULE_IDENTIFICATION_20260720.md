# W109 — G6 bond-schedule identifications (2026-07-20)

Cluster push after the G3-01 BINOM landing. Two lanes opened the same day;
both cracked at the SEMANTIC level within hours by exact-constraint methods
(single-witness hypothesis first, lattice capture second, bit-race third).
Work dir: `smart-fuzzer/work/w109/G6-b2b3/` (gitignored). Agents: agent-V
(PRICE staging + landing), agent-W (ACCRINT identification).

## Lane A — G6-03d: PRICE at Actual/360 & Actual/365 (material, ~cents)

**Identity: Excel's PRICE derives the settlement discount fraction with a
UNIVERSAL rule `dsc = E − A`** — it never counts days settlement→next-coupon
directly.

- `E` = coupon period length by basis: `360/f` (bases 0, 2, 4), `365/f`
  (basis 3), actual days (basis 1).
- `A` = accrued days PCD→settlement by basis (actual for 1/2/3, 30/360 for
  0/4).
- On bases 0/1/4, `E − A` coincides with the direct count (except
  settlement-on-the-31st 30/360 rows — where `E − A` is ALSO the fix), which
  is why the rule stayed invisible: it only diverges on Actual/360 and
  Actual/365, where `E` is a fiction (180 / 182.5) and `A` is real days.
- First-try witness check: `PRICE(2020-09-20, 2025-01-01, .06, .03, 103, 2,
  basis 2)`: off = (180−81)/180 = 0.55 → 114.588731 = Excel's 114.5887
  (OxFunc/faithful-formula: 103/180 → 114.550379, 3.8 cents low).

**The oracle disagrees with itself:** Excel's published `COUPDAYSNC` returns
ACTUAL days (103) at bases 2/3 on the same arguments — 458/458 captured rows
at each of bases 2/3 have `pub ≠ E−A`, while all 144 basis-0/1/4 rows have
`pub == E−A`. PRICE's internal DSC is not COUPDAYSNC. (OxFunc's COUP*
functions were never the problem.)

**b37 battery** (7,472 PRICE rows: bonds BE mat 45658 r.06 red103 f2 /
BL mat 45717 r.045 f2 leap-Feb period / BQ mat 45658 r.08 f4; settlement
day-ladders × 8 yields × bases 2,3 + sparse 0,1,4 controls; plus 6×1,060
COUP* rows). Four-variant race (`race_b37.py`, plain-double emulation):

| variant | b2 exact | b3 exact | b0 | b1 | b4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| direct-dsc / powf | 0/3664 | 0/3664 | 43/48 | 46/48 | 43/48 |
| direct-dsc / binexp | 0/3664 | 0/3664 | 45/48 | 48/48 | 45/48 |
| **e−a / binexp** | **3474/3664** | **3446/3664** | **48/48** | **48/48** | 45/48* |

\* the 3 b4 misses are the emulator's day-count shortcut (US 30/360 used for
European dates), not Excel. Residual after the semantic fix: ±1..4 ULP
staging micro-detail (~190 b2 + ~218 b3 rows) — agent-V racing (fractional
pow realization, per-op x87 DR staging, summation order), then landing
`dsc = e − a` in `pcomp_disc` + fresh b38 held-out gate.

Direction of error vs the F# ExcelFinancialFunctions lineage: EFF (and
OxFunc's faithful port) implements the DOCUMENTED quantity (actual DSR);
Excel's ATP implements the derived one. Same porting-hole pattern as
msvcr100's missing expm1/log1p: the published description is not the code.

## Lane B — G6-02: ACCRINT calc_method semantics (material, was "1 ULP")

The catalog row said one 1-ULP witness. The b39 lattice (25,410 rows: bonds
W/Q/A/E, settlement every 3rd day across ~2.5 periods, bases 0-4, rates
.05/.037/.0615, par 1000/997.5, calc_method both) says the row was hiding a
semantic divergence:

- **Excel calc_method=FALSE is the LEGACY FLAT computation**: one fraction,
  no period structure — `a = days(issue→settlement, by basis) / canonical`,
  result `par·rate/f·a`. Verified e.g. W bond settlement 43833 basis 2 par
  997.5: Excel 37.129167 = 24.9375·(268/180), 268 actual days issue→settle.
- **Excel calc_method=TRUE = the period-aware walk** (partial + 1.0 per
  whole period + tail partial) — what OxFunc implements for TRUE.
- The two are bit-identical on 7,752/12,705 captured pairs (pre-first
  regime, and 30/360-aligned post rows where flat ≡ sum), differ by ±1-2 ULP
  on staging elsewhere pre-first, and split MATERIALLY post-first on actual
  bases (4,227 pairs, e.g. 268/180 flat vs 84/180+1 walk).
- **OxFunc's FALSE (accrue from one period before first) matches NEITHER**
  — production scores 17,967/25,410 with ~6,100 material calc=FALSE rows.
- Remaining sub-classes for agent-W: ±1-2 ULP staging both paths (~1,100
  rows); a material 219-row TRUE-path class on bond Q (quarterly, basis 1,
  post-first) — suspect canonical/period handling; several 3-row
  (settlement × 3 rates) boundary groups.

Production scorer: `check_accrint` bin (calc_graph_racer). Residual bank:
`b39_resid.json`.

## Method note (for the ledger)

Both lanes cracked on the SAME move: treat the single catalog witness as an
exact equation, hand-test the 2-3 structurally distinct conventions against
it in plain arithmetic BEFORE capturing anything, then confirm the winning
hypothesis at the bit level on a lattice. The b37/b39 lattices were designed
AFTER the hypothesis, as confirmation + staging instruments, not as search
corpora. Contrast with the G3 walls, where the op-graph family is genuinely
outside parametrization — here the divergences were one source line each
(`dsc = e − a`; flat-vs-walk behind `calc_method`).

## Lane A — LANDED + GATED (2026-07-20, agent-V)

Staging identification on top of `dsc = e − a`:

1. **Fractional discount pow = the x87 CRT chain** `exp(RN53(RN64(y·ln x)))`
   — byte-identical to production `excel_numeric::excel_pow_chain`, i.e. the
   SAME pow recovered independently in the G3 lane-1 distribution-substrate
   work. Cross-lane confirmation, verified against hardware `x87_serve`.
   Alone lifts b2 3474→3656, b3 3446→3658.
2. **Body = plain single-rounded double**, coupons ascending + separate
   redemption term. Refuted (b2+b3 exact of 7,328): sep+powf 7,120; folded
   redemption 5,117; reversed 6,493; extended-accumulator family 4,665-5,500;
   reciprocal-multiply 4,817; x87-per-op-DR body worse. Winner sep+x87chain
   7,314 (emulator), production 7,458/7,472 overall.

Landed: `pcomp_disc` `dsc = e − a` (universal, all callers);
`excel_bond_pow` fractional branch → `excel_pow_chain` (PRICE-only via
`binexp=true`). Pins `price_dsc_e_minus_a_and_x87_pow_chain_pins` (catalog
witness `0x405ca5adc69c74fb`, basis-3 sibling, settle-on-31st basis-0, pow
discriminator). Full suite 1,510 green, zero pin movement, YIELD pins
byte-stable. **Fresh b38 held-out: 945/945 across all five bases** (5 new
bonds, month-end/leap/n=1/extreme-yield). Coordinator re-ran the gate +
suite independently — reproduced.

Open residual (NOT accepted): 14 extreme-yield rows ±1 ULP
(`agentV_residual14.json`, with 250-bit true-sum bits per row — Excel's
published value sits up to +3 ULP ABOVE the correctly-rounded true sum, an
accumulation op-graph fact). Next probe: adjacent-double yld bracket +
truncated-ladder partial sums (battery b41). Blast radius: DURATION now
inherits the `E−A` dirty on bases 2/3 (its own open lane G6-03c); YIELD
unchanged on its pinned witnesses.

Canonical agent record: `smart-fuzzer/work/w109/G6-b2b3/agentV_results.md`.

## Lane B — LANDED + TWICE-HELD-OUT GATED (2026-07-20, agent-W)

Final model (all plain SSE2 double — x87 emulation strictly worse on both
paths; ACCRINT sits in the 2010-rewrite SSE2 body class with GRATIO/BRATIO,
NOT the x87 legacy-financial class):

1. **calc_method=FALSE = flat fraction + WHOLE-PERIOD SKIP.** For issue
   inside the canonical period: `days(issue→settle)/canonical`. For issue in
   an EARLIER coupon period: stub `[issue, B1]/L_issue` + `[pcd, settle]/
   canonical` as two divisions summed — every whole grid period between B1
   and pcd contributes NOTHING. Consequence Excel faithfully publishes:
   accrual is NEGATIVE when settlement < pcd (pinned in the regression
   test). The b40 gate falsified the first version of this rule (remainder
   measured from B1, not pcd) — exactly the under-determined corner the
   battery was designed to expose; the skip-rule revision then passed the
   fresh b42.
2. **calc_method=TRUE = period walk summed BACKWARD** (settlement side
   first; forward accumulation is 1 ULP off on ~9% of rows). Interior whole
   periods = 1.0; act/act issue stub by its own actual length; the
   settlement-side period is ALWAYS days/canonical, even when settlement
   lands exactly on a coupon date.

Gates (coordinator-verified on the production kernel via check_accrint):
b39 ident 25,407/25,410; **b40 fresh 51,417/51,420; b42 fresh
68,783/68,790** — combined 145,607/145,620 (99.991%). Suite 1,511 green,
zero pin movement (the historic BUG-FUNC-030 leap-Feb pin was a true Excel
witness and survived unchanged). Landed: `accrint_kernel` rewrite +
`issue_period_grid` helper + `accrint_staging_bit_exact_vs_excel_w109`
(8 live pins incl. the negative-accrual skip witness and a c0/c1 1-ULP
pair).

Open residual (NOT accepted): 13 bistable rows across the three corpora,
ALL at rate 0.0615 — perfectly rate-selective across bonds, bases,
calc_methods, and regimes. The flip therefore lives in the
`par·rate/f`/publication last-bit staging, not the day-count layer.
Next probe: b43 rate ladder 0.0615 ± k·ulp on the flagged bonds.
Canonical agent record: `smart-fuzzer/work/w109/G6-b2b3/agentW_results.md`.

## Lane C — G6-03c DURATION/MDURATION: LANDED + GATED (2026-07-20, agent-X)

Identity: `off = (E−A)/E` (shares PRICE's derived schedule — the docs-era
kernel weighted with the DIRECT settlement→next span while dividing by the
E−A dirty, a mixed state that put bases 2/3 at 0/1272); discount =
`excel_bond_pow` (the PRICE substrate); Macaulay body = plain-f64 SSE2 with
redemption separate, weights grouped `(diff·cash)/disc`, publication
`num/den/f` over its OWN sums. Accrued span A = CoupDaysBS
`diff360_us(prev, settle, ModifyStartDate)`, NOT plain `us_30_360`: the two
differ only on 31st/month-end settlements by adjustment ORDER (a 1-integer A
difference ≈ 2.5e13 ULP of duration).

The gates earned their keep AGAIN: the b45 pre-registered gate (456/540)
exposed the month-end A-convention break that b44 could not see; the fix is
one line; the fresh month-end-majority b46 then gated clean — DURATION
641/720 exact / all misses ±2 / zero material, MDURATION 644/720 mirroring
exactly (the `/(1+yld/f)` staging is validated). b44 final 6217/6360.
Suite 1,609 green, 8 pins added (both former catalog witnesses now exact).

Open residual (NOT accepted): the off-coupon ±1-2 ULP class
(`agentX_b44_residual143.json`, symmetric {−2:14, −1:59, +1:56, +2:14}) —
the SAME shared fractional pow-chain wall PRICE left open; one cross-lane
probe (b41/b43 family) covers both.

Three same-day landings from one cluster: PRICE (b38 945/945), ACCRINT
(b40+b42 145,607/145,620), DURATION/MDURATION (b46 641+644/720 ±2). Every
lane followed hypothesis-first → lattice → pre-registered held-out gate,
and TWO of the three had a wrong sub-rule caught only by the gate.

## b43 probe — the 0.0615 bistables SHARPENED (2026-07-20, coordinator)

Rate-ULP ladders (0.0615 ± 32 ulps × the 12 unique bistable rows, 780 live
rows): **the flip is ISOLATED at exactly the double nearest 0.0615 — all 64
neighbors bit-exact on all 12 ladders.** A staging difference would flip in
bands or scattered points; an isolated single-input flip recurring across
different bonds/dates/calc-paths is a TIE/publication phenomenon. Second
selector: all 13 rows are basis 3 (canonical 182.5) or basis 1 (actual) —
never 0/2/4 — so the fractional/irregular divisor is a co-condition.
Refuted on-row: 15-significant-digit publication snap (4/12, and the
failures go the WRONG WAY — ours is the short decimal, Excel's the
neighbor); naive DR-final-multiply and DR-coup-chain (0/12, but the probe
reconstructed `a` circularly from our own result — REDO with the model's
exact day-count quantities before trusting this refutation).
NEXT PROBE (banked, offline-ready): recompute each row's exact `a` from
agentW_model2.py quantities, race {SSE2, DR-final, DR-all, extended-a}
variants at 250-bit reference to find which op hits a 53-bit tie at exactly
the 0.0615 double; then a par-ladder (997.5 ± k·ulp) to separate
rate-tie from product-tie. Corpus: batch/answers-b43-accrint.json.

# Lane D — PMT / annuity ring (G6-01), 2026-07-21 (coordinator, Opus)

The financial-time-value ring (PMT/PV/FV/IPMT/PPMT/CUMPRINC) attacked with the
**metamorphic-sibling method** on the disjoint 875-row held-out corpus
(`answers-pmt-heldout.json`) + the 48-row r0. New tooling:
`tools/calc_graph_racer/src/bin/race_pmt_substrate.rs`, `race_pmt_x87stable.rs`;
`work/w109/G6-solvers/pmt_combine_search.py`, `gen_pmt_meta.py`, `pmt_meta_test.py`.

## Finding 1 — FV/PV and PMT use DIFFERENT algorithms (metamorphic proof)

`annuity_family_race.py` (re-run): **FV var0 = 149/149 and PV var0/var2 = 48/48
bit-exact** with the *naive FORWARD* binexp kernel in **plain SSE2 double**:
`P = binexp(1+r, n)` (LSB-first square-and-multiply), `q = (P-1)/r`,
`tf = 1 + r·type`, `fv = -(pv·P + pmt·(tf·q))`, `pv = -(fv + pmt·(tf·q))/P`.
So Excel's forward annuity factor is PINNED bit-exact.

PMT reuses none of it. Metamorphic harvest (`gen_pmt_meta.py` → 621 FV probes,
`answers-pmt-meta-fv.json`): `P = -FV(r,n,0,1,0)` and `tf·q = -FV(r,n,1,0,ty)`
give Excel's OWN internal factors. Feeding them into `-(pv·P+fv)/(tf·q)`
(`pmt_meta_test.py`) scores **242/923 and is 0/109 on every small/tiny/negative
rate**. If PMT shared FV's forward factor this would close. It does not →
**PMT is a numerically-STABLE (discount) form; FV/PV are the naive forward form.
The siblings do not share the annuity factor.** (Human-written code reused the
helper for FV/PV but PMT's author chose a cancellation-safe path.)

## Finding 2 — the residual is the transcendental primitive, nothing else

Discount identity: `em = expm1(-n·log1p r)`, `v = 1+em = (1+r)^-n`,
`pmt = (pv + fv·v)·r / (tf·em)`.

Held-out ceilings (ranked by held-out, overfit-guarded):
- `race_pmt_substrate` (SSE2 body, x87/CRT transcendentals): champion
  **482/875** at `L=log1pCR E=expm1_internal arr=num/den·r`. Prior forward-pow
  zoo (`fit_pmt_stores`) ceiling was ~57% — same ballpark, different family.
- `race_pmt_x87stable` (WHOLE body per-op x87 double-rounded + x87 log1p/expm1):
  **460/875**, and **completely invariant to the 8-bit store-mask** (every mask
  ties). So body precision (SSE2 ≈ x87-DR) and spill-staging are NOT the gap.
- `pmt_combine_search` (plain-double forward final-combine, 23 arrangements):
  ≤262/875, small-rate-catastrophic — forward is wrong for PMT (confirms F1).

**n=1 isolation lane** (125 rows, pure `expm1(-log1p r)` test): hard ceiling
**62-65/125** identical across the plain closed form `-(pv·(1+r)+fv)/tf`, every
discount provider, forward and x87-DR. The misses **sign-flip with rate
magnitude** (Excel more-negative than the naive form at small rate, less-negative
above ~0.8%). That sawtooth = the exact rounding point of Excel's `log1p`/`expm1`,
which is **none of**: portable-CR `log1p`/`expm1`, the identified internal
Kahan-corrected F2XM1 `expm1_internal`, the raw base-2 hardware `fyl2xp1`/`f2xm1`,
or `ln(1+r)` (forming 1+r first). Ruled out by elimination: form, body precision,
store-mask, and all four known primitives.

## Status + NEXT PROBE (banked)

PMT = stable discount form; residual localized to Excel's **exact annuity
`log1p`/`expm1`** (a bespoke or CRT routine we have not reproduced). This is a
primitive-ID problem of the same class as the G3 internal-exp/expm1 lanes
(task #16, agent-solved). NEXT: isolate Excel's `em` bit-exactly via the
fv=0/ty=0 rows (single division `pmt = pv·r/(tf·em)` → em recoverable to ~1 ULP
by the exact-interval instrument, cf. b34), tabulate em(r,n) vs candidate
routines, and micro-stage search {raw-F2XM1-no-Kahan, RZ vs RN final store,
alt reduction, MSVC/Cephes expm1 forms} at 250-bit reference. CUMPRINC/PPMT/IPMT
(G6-07) inherit PMT's residual and close with it. Corpora ready:
`answers-pmt-heldout.json`, `answers-pmt-meta-fv.json`.

## Lane D continued — em-isolation capture (2026-07-21, Fable-designed probe)

Fable consult reframe: the PMT residual has TWO sources — (a) the small-rate
one-signed lower branch = the em primitive (a fixed-sign absolute error amplified
by 1/|em|), (b) the +branch = body/arrangement. Decisive probe (`gen_pmt_em_probe.py`
→ 13,752 live rows `answers-pmt-em.json`): **fv=0, type=0, pv∈{1,1.5}** collapses
the arrangement to `pmt = RN(pv·r/em)`, so `fl(pv·r/em_candidate)==pmt_excel`
directly scores each em routine. r log-spaced [1e-6,0.05] sign-mirrored ×
n∈{1..480 mixed-popcount}. **This grid IS Excel's em oracle** (recover em = r/pmt).

Racer `race_pmt_em.rs` (REAL x87 F2XM1/FYL2XP1, mpmath can't emulate the
instruction chain). Scores on the pv=1 collapsed grid (6876 rows):
- **internal-Kahan expm1 (on log1p-CR): 4050/6876 = 59% — BEST**, and UNIFORM
  across every |t|=|n·log1p r| regime (59% at |t|<0.25, 0.25-1, 1-4, 4+).
- CR expm1 48%; raw F2XM1-fold RN 48%, RZ/chop 37%; exp(t)-1 12%; no-fold 12%.
- Pure x87 SPILL (em EXTENDED, single final store, no double-store of em): 45% —
  WORSE than storing em to double first. So em IS materialized to double before
  the divide; the body is not a single-store extended spill.
- `v = pow_chain(1+r,-n)` (forming 1+r, Excel's POWER pow): **refuted, <1%
  everywhere** — the annuity does NOT form 1+r; it uses a genuine log1p.
- Regime-split (expfold small-|t| / powchain large-|t|): max 792/6876 — worse
  than uniform internal. NOT regime-split.

**Localization (final for this cycle):** PMT = stable discount form, x87
substrate, em = internal-Kahan-style F2XM1 expm1 on a natural log1p; the residual
is a UNIFORM ~1 ULP difference between `excel_expm1_internal` and Excel's exact
annuity expm1 on ~41% of the isolated grid — a sub-op rounding in the shared chain,
not a wrong family/regime/form. RULED OUT this cycle: forward decomposition,
Gnumeric forward-stable, body precision (SSE2≈x87-DR), store-mask, extended-fold
spill, chop store, exp-1, pow_chain(1+r,-n), ln(1+r), regime-split. **NEXT** (clean
handoff): micro-stage which sub-op of the internal-Kahan chain (the fFEXP final
store RN vs the Kahan `(u-1)·t/ln u` correction ops, or the log1p delivery) rounds
differently, scored against the 13,752-row em oracle; recover em=r/pmt to bits via
the exact-interval instrument and fit the per-op rounding. CUMPRINC/PPMT/IPMT
inherit + close with it.

# Lane E — RATE (G6-05), 2026-07-21 (agent-R)

RATE solver identified via the metamorphic lever (RATE finds r where FV(r,…)=fv;
FV is the closed forward-binexp balance). SETTLED: **forward-difference Newton in
r-space** (IRR's v-space sibling), FD step h=1e-6·x, stop |f|<1e-7 publishing the
stepped iterate, cap ~100, #NUM! on cap/domain/non-finite. Balance = pv·(1+r)^nper
+ pmt·(1/r+type)·((1+r)^nper−1) + fv. **POWER = x87 87tran exp·ln** (confirmed by
#NUM! basin: x87chain 15/15 vs binexp/powf 10/15). **Basin 116/116** all corpora.
Secant refuted (false-converges on #NUM! rows). OPEN: exact bits 0-2/101 — the
balance catastrophic-cancellation op-graph (~1 ULP-of-f amplified 5-60× near root),
not closed by {dbl, Ext80, per-op-DR}×{5 pow}×{4 deriv}×{2 arr}. Racer race_rate.rs.
Next lever: r1/r2 near-root one-step ladder (single Newton step, no trajectory
chaos) to pin the balance spill + FD-h form.

# Lane D — PMT combine (G6-01), 2026-07-21 update (coordinator + agent-Q)

The combine (given em) is NOT a single-shared-quantity form: control-clean tests
(agent-Q) show single-em all-8-pv REAL 7.1% vs mismatched-CONTROL 0.0% (genuine but
only 7%); forward-(P,q) "82%" was pure over-fit (control 80%). Coordinator's 256-
CONSECUTIVE-pv sweep (answers-pmt-combsweep.json, over-fit-proof) independently
refutes every 1-/2-constant form (shared-em ≤214/256, forward-(P,q) no fit even
P±500ulp, fused/recip/x87-div all ≤205/256). ROBUST facts: pmt(pv)/pmt(1) within ≤1
ulp of pv (pv scales a base); the residual vs RN(pv·base) is ONE-SIDED (Excel
systematically MORE negative: {0:112,+1:126,+2:13} at (0.05,12)) → an extended
accumulator / truncation biasing high; pv·r is NOT pre-rounded (exact-num divide 62%
> pre-rounded 55.6%). CONCLUSION: the combine carries a SECOND independently-rounded
(r,n)-quantity (the forward P,q pair or v alongside em), with an x87 extended
intermediate. Path: pin the 2nd quantity (v) model-free from the fv≠0 rows
(answers-pmt-fvty.json) + gold em, over-fit-controlled; validate the final op-graph
on the 256-consecutive-pv sweep. Fable consult running on the exact x87 spill.

## Lane D — PMT COMBINE SOLVED (2026-07-21, Fable consult): quotient-first H-DF

BREAKTHROUGH. Every combine form the coordinator + agent-Q raced multiplied
`pv·r` FIRST and capped ~55-80% on the over-fit-proof 256-consecutive-pv sweep.
Fable's insight: the VB/BASIC financial lineage does **quotient FIRST, `·rate`
LAST**. The combine is:
  **pmt = RN( RN( num / den ) · r )**,  num = pv + fv·(1+em),  den = em·tf,
  tf = 1 + r·type.   (fv=0,type=0 → RN(RN(pv/em)·r).)
Fable PROVED product-first impossible via an anchored-phase argument: pv=1.0 is
exact so RN(pv·r)=r forces the product stage to phase 0 → a slope-1.6 staircase
{0,2,3,5,6,8,10}, which no divisor (any precision) can reshape into the observed
{0,1,3,4,6,9,11}; the 3-step jump alone requires TWO coarse pv-dependent stages,
which a single product/divide cannot produce. (This impossibility argument is
Last Bit material.)

VALIDATION (`race_pmt_hdf.rs`, real x87 internal-Kahan em):
- Consecutive-pv sweep: H-DF **256/256 on ALL 9 sweeps** (product-first 134-214);
  combsweep corpus **2304/2304 = 100% EXACT** with the COMPUTED (not searched) em.
- Full held-out 482/875 exact / 88% ±1; em corpus 10801/13752 (78%/92% ±1);
  pvladder 43026/55008 (78%/92% ±1). fvty 42%/74% (fv≠0 wants a v-source check:
  v=1+em vs v=exp(tau)).
So the COMBINE ARRANGEMENT IS SOLVED; the entire remaining ±1 ULP residual is `em`
bit-exact (agent-P's x87 expm1 lane) — NOT a combine gap. The prior gold em oracle
was product-first-contaminated; re-extract em under H-DF (256-pv sweep → unique em
per (r,n)) for a clean agent-P oracle. Next: Fable's r=2⁻⁵ probe (exact ·r) to pin
em to ~2⁻⁶⁰ and settle the divide spill (em f64 vs extended).

### H-DF em oracle (r=2⁻ᵏ trick, 2026-07-21)
Fable's power-of-2-rate probe generalized: at r=2⁻ᵏ, `·r` is exact → H-DF collapses
to a pure divide → em pinned to <0.01 ulp by 256 consecutive pv. Captured a broad
grid (6 r × 9 n, batch-pmt-po2.json) → **Excel's EXACT em at 46 (r,n)**
(pmt_em_hdf_oracle.json). Result: **35/46 match correctly-rounded expm1, 11/46 are
±1 ulp off** (8 at +1, 3 at −1). That is the ENTIRE remaining fv=0 residual, pinned
to the bit and decoupled from the combine. race_pmt_hdf (internal-Kahan em):
combsweep 2304/2304 (100%), po2 11990/13824 (87%), r25 1539/2304 (67%) — internal-
Kahan ≈ CR, so it misses exactly the 11 off-CR (r,n). CLOSURE = (a) the exact expm1
op-graph matching all 46 (agent-P), and (b) the fv≠0/ty=1 H-DF num/tf details
(agent-Q; fv=0/ty=0 skeleton solved). agent-Q's earlier "single-divide empty" was
for PRODUCT-first RN(NUM/em) — H-DF is QUOTIENT-first (two roundings), which its
"multi-rounding" instinct correctly anticipated.

### PMT closure state (2026-07-21, agent-P + agent-Q on H-DF)
- **expm1 SOLVED (agent-P, 87/87 bit-exact)**: em = internal double-rounded Kahan
  `(u−1)·t/ln(u)` for |tau|<1, `exp(tau)−1` for |tau|≥1; u=exp(tau), reproduces ALL
  46 HDF + 41 pox oracle points PROVIDED log1p is Excel's actual value. The exp/ln
  primitives are proven exact (worksheet EXP(t)==u, LN(u)==CR, all 12 probe args).
- **tf placement PINNED (agent-Q, 256/256)**: pmt = RN(RN(RN(num/em)/tf)·r),
  tf=RN(1+r·type) SSE2 — tf is a SEPARATE middle divide between /em and ·r (den=em·tf
  and tf-last both 0/256). num=pv+fv·v. type=0 → tf=1 → reduces to H-DF.
- **RESIDUAL = Excel's non-CR log1p** (the sole fv=0 unknown): a genuine Excel
  imprecision (per "Excel imprecision is still a bug", reproduce not fix). Standard
  log1p (fyl2xp1/portable/ln(1+r)/fdlibm) are ALL bit-identical to CR at these rates.
  Coordinator n=1 map (answers-pmt-log1p.json, 113 r × 256 pv, tau=−log1p r isolates
  it): deviation is a STRUCTURED ±1-2 ulp non-CR pattern concentrated near 2⁻⁴/2⁻⁵
  (agent-P's pox map: uniform +1 at 2⁻⁵,2⁻⁴; n=1 map shows ±1-2 across their
  neighbors, 2⁻⁶→−1, 2⁻²→−1). Same log1p feeds agent-Q's v=(1+r)^−n, so IDing it
  closes both. Open: (a) the exact log1p op-graph (agent-P, n=1 oracle captured);
  (b) the fv num=pv+fv·v op-order (agent-Q, fv=±1 non-degenerate sweep captured).
So PMT is at NEAR-TOTAL closure: combine + expm1 solved bit-exact; only a non-CR
log1p imprecision and the fv-num assembly remain.

### PMT COMBINE OP-GRAPH — FULLY PINNED (agent-Q, 2026-07-21, over-fit-safe)
From the non-degenerate fv=±1 consecutive-pv sweeps, the complete final combine
(all SSE2 double, quotient-first):
```
  num = RN(pv + fv·v)        # v = (1+r)^-n discount factor; fv·v then +pv
  q1  = RN(num / em)         # em = (1+r)^-n − 1
  q2  = RN(q1 / tf)          # tf = RN(1 + r·type); type=0 → tf=1 → q2=q1
  pmt = RN(q2 · r)           # ×rate LAST
```
Discriminated 256/256: num=pv+fv·v (not two-term, not x87-extended — inverting gives
num−pv = v = constant across pv); tf is a SEPARATE MIDDLE DIVIDE (den=em·tf → 0/256,
tf-last → 0/256, /tf-middle → 256/256); fv=−1 v-insensitive 256/256; fv=0 → H-DF
99.7%/0%-control. The whole-skeleton residual (49.9%, bounded ±3, +biased) is ENTIRELY
the coupled {em, v} precision — em and v cannot be separated (no single double-v closes
fv=+1), because both flow from the SAME internal tau=−n·(non-CR log1p).

**PMT is therefore reduced to a SINGLE open primitive: Excel's non-CR log1p.** Combine
(agent-Q) + expm1/exp arithmetic (agent-P, 87/87) are both solved bit-exact. Full PMT
= the op-graph above + {em=expm1(tau), v=exp(tau)} once Excel's exact log1p is IDed
(agent-P's final lane; n=1 oracle answers-pmt-log1p.json captured).

### log1p — the final open primitive (2026-07-21; 3rd Fable consult REFUTED end-to-end)
Fable proposed Excel's log1p = the **Kahan companion trick** `u=fl(1+r); ln(u)·r/(u−1)`
(the algebraic dual of the solved expm1), with a compelling period-law argument: ε=u−(1+r)
is a sawtooth of period 2⁻ᵉ per binade, matching the dense-sweep ramp-at-2⁻⁸ (period 256)
and ripple-at-2⁻³ (period 8). BUT end-to-end race (race_pmt_hdf, all op-orders + extended
+ x87-ln) REFUTES it: every variant makes combsweep 2304→1724 and helps nothing. Diagnosis:
the po2 rates are all **ε=0** (1+2⁻ᵏ exact → Kahan correction r/(u−1)=1 → degenerates to plain
ln(u)), so they can't discriminate; the ε≠0 combsweep rates DO, and there **Excel matches CR
log1p, not the Kahan form**. So Excel's PMT log1p is CR on well-conditioned (ε≠0) rows and
non-CR only on a specific subset — NOT the Kahan companion, NOT any standard routine. RULED
OUT now: CR/portable, fyl2xp1 (all deliveries), fdlibm, Cephes, ln(1+r)/fyl2x, Kahan
companion. STATUS: the sole open PMT primitive; a genuine Excel imprecision, characterized
(faithful ~0.6 ulp, non-CR, dev-sign follows sub-ulp position, smooth per-binade error curve
of period 2⁻ᵉ), fingerprint data captured (answers-pmt-log1p + answers-pmt-denselog1p, 3
binades × 256 consecutive r). NEXT-SESSION: fit the routine from the dense curve (Fable probe
A: dev-vs-low-bits phase-lock + ε=0 sublattice; probe C: negative-r/binade-2⁻¹ period tests).
**PMT is otherwise fully solved: combine (H-DF, quotient-first, tf middle divide) + expm1
(internal Kahan) are bit-exact; only this one non-CR log1p imprecision blocks a bit-exact
landing.**

### log1p — the "non-CR log1p" is a MISDIAGNOSIS; the wall is expm1 double-rounding (2026-07-23)
The prior section's premise is WRONG and is retracted here. Excel's PMT log1p is
**CORRECTLY ROUNDED**, and the residual attributed to it is actually the expm1/tau
double-rounding. Decisive evidence, all model-free:

1. **LN at exactly-representable 1+r = CR, 148/148.** At r=2⁻ᵏ (and r=j·2⁻⁸,j·2⁻⁹) the
   argument 1+r is EXACT, so log1p(r)=ln(1+r) with no argument rounding. Direct live
   `LN(1+r)` oracle (batch-ln-exact, 148 pts spanning the dense-sweep region): **0 non-CR**.
   The x87 `FYL2XP1`/`FYL2X`-on-exact-ext hardware (real inline asm on this AMD host) also
   equals CR there — so log1p is not the deviation source.
2. **Internal exp is bit-exact.** For all 234 |tau|<1 po2×n points, live `EXP(tau_d)` == the
   x87 `excel_exp` emulation, **234/234** (batch-em-exp). `LN(u)` likewise matches.
3. **The residual is the expm1 |tau|<1 branch.** Model-free em oracle (r=2⁻ᵏ trick × n∈
   {1..64}, answers-pmt-po2n, 258 pinned (r,n)): the all-double Kahan `(u−1)·t/ln(u)`
   reproduces **163/234 (70%)** on |tau|<1; the |tau|≥1 (`u−1`) branch is **100%** (all
   3840 pts). With tau, u=exp(tau), and ln(u) ALL proven-identical doubles to Excel's, no
   double-op SEQUENCE tested closes the gap: 12 forms raced (prod-first / Kahan-canonical /
   div-first associations; additive corrections `b+b·(t−lnu)/lnu` and relatives; `t·b/lnu`
   numerator; denominators `fyl2x(u)`/`fyl2xp1(u−1)`/`log1pCR(u−1)`) — ceiling **163**,
   second cluster 145. Extended stagings (ext tau, ext correction, full-ext, ext-divide)
   and the base-2 `F2XM1(−n·log2(1+r))` path are all WORSE (99–152). So Excel's em on the
   71 miss points ≠ any Kahan/expm1 op-graph over the observable {tau,u,ln u}.

**Reconciliation with the "expm1 SOLVED 87/87":** the 87 HDF+pox points did not stress the
|tau|<1 double-rounding (mostly |tau|≥1 or a favorable subset). The po2×n oracle is the
held-out that exposes the true 70% ceiling — a textbook [[validate-workflow-ids-on-heldout]]
correction. **PMT residual is therefore an expm1 |tau|<1 double-rounding OP-GRAPH WALL**
(class of [[remaining-lanes-are-opgraph-walls]]), NOT a log1p imprecision. The large-|fv|
assembly failures (fvsweep 0/1024 under discount `(num/em)/tf·r`; product-order denom
`(num·r)/(tf·em)` 512/1024) are the SAME wall amplified: v=(1+r)⁻ⁿ=1+em cancels for large n
(v tiny) and, even with v=exp(tau), the em denominator carries the ±1. Discount combine
`[0] (num/em)/tf·r` remains Excel's form for fv=0 (combsweep 2304/2304, pvladder best);
forward-exp `−(pv·P+fv)/((P−1)/r)/tf` with x87 P=exp(n·log1p r) is worse on every corpus.

### PMT em is NOT Excel's standard expm1; the wall is REAL, toward-zero-biased (2026-07-23, big workflow)
A 12-agent exploration workflow + coordinator oracle work resolved WHAT the residual is and
exhaustively bounded it. Three decisive new results:

1. **PMT's em ≠ Excel's standard expm1.** `EXPON.DIST(x,1,TRUE)=1−e^−x` exposes Excel's expm1
   DIRECTLY: `expm1(tau) = −EXPON.DIST(−tau,1,TRUE)`. Excel's EXPON.DIST expm1 == the all-double
   Kahan model **232/234**, but PMT's pinned em matches that same Kahan only **165/234** — and at
   IDENTICAL tau (n=power-of-two → tau exact) EXPON.DIST gives Kahan while PMT gives something
   else. So PMT's annuity `(1+r)⁻ⁿ−1` is a **financial-body-specific routine, distinct from the
   statistical expm1** (which the old "87/87" measured). This is why no {tau,u,ln u} op-graph closes it.
2. **The residual is REAL, not a po2 (r=2⁻ᵏ) sampling artifact.** On generic rates `r=m·2⁻ᵏ`
   (m∈{3,5,7} odd, 1+r still exact → log1p CR), the all-double Kahan still matches only **61/90 (68%)**
   with the SAME structure: signed residual `em_pinned−Kahan = {0:61,+1:25,+2:3,+3:1}`, **never
   negative** — a systematic **toward-zero bias** (Excel underestimates |expm1|), pure `{0,+1}` at
   small |tau|. Consolidated 324-point `delta(tau)=em_pinned−CR_expm1` is a **±1–2 ULP spread with a
   toward-zero bias, NOT a smooth curve** → a genuine last-bit op-graph effect, not a fittable
   coefficient error.
3. **Exhaustively refuted (multi-agent SLP enumeration + coordinator x87 races):** extended-x87
   single-store (F2XM1-native 106, ext-u−1 99, ext-Kahan 133, all < 163), polynomial/rational
   (fdlibm 129, Cephes 84, CR-expm1 133 — Excel is LESS accurate than CR, so not a library expm1),
   directed rounding / chop of Kahan (112–119), binexp power (refuted on |tau|≥1: 18/24 vs exp 100%).
   The all-double Kahan `(u−1)·t/ln(u)` is the firm **163/234 ceiling**; a double-rounded numerator
   `RN53(RN64(b·t))/ln(u)` nudges to 165. **Interpretation: a hand-coded inline expm1 (tiny-arg fast
   path that overshoots toward zero + a reduced main path) that systematically underestimates |expm1|
   by ≤1 ULP — a real Excel imprecision, op-graph outside every tested family.** Reproduce, don't fix.

**Provenance (workflow, verbatim public source):** LibreOffice/OpenOffice `ScGetPMT` and Gnumeric
`pow1pm1` confirm the EXPRESSION `em=expm1(±n·log1p r)` but use POSITIVE-tau forward assembly +
a library (near-CR) expm1 — refuted as Excel's op-graph (Excel is −tau discount + non-CR). numpy/
VB6/.NET use `pow(1+r,+n)` subtractive — refuted. **No open reference implementation matches Excel's
−tau discount + bespoke non-CR expm1 arrangement; Excel PMT is a distinct, older, x87-native MS routine.**

**Related-function inheritance map (workflow):** PMT → {IPMT, PPMT} → {CUMIPMT, CUMPRINC} (IPMT/PPMT
consume PMT's payment; CUM* sum them). FV/PV (forward binexp, closed 149/149 + 48/48), NPER (x87,
closed 1729/1729), NPV, RATE (FD-Newton, mechanism IDed), IRR do NOT inherit PMT's expm1. So closing
PMT's expm1 op-graph closes five functions. NOTE: the naive `IPMT(per)==RN(FV(per−1)·r)` inheritance
was REFUTED against the live oracle (0/9, diverging) — the exact IPMT balance recurrence needs its own
identification, not the simple FV·r form. fvsweep is a DEGENERATE corpus (Excel returned constant across
256 fine-sweep pv — a generation artifact); drop it as a combine oracle.

### SLP/DAG enumeration EXECUTED — confirms the wall, does not break it (2026-07-23)
Per user direction, mounted the systematic straight-line-program search on the |tau|<1 em. Since u=exp(tau)
and lnu=ln(u) are captured EXACT doubles, ran the enumeration in pure Python (float=RN53) for instant
iteration, plus x87 stagings in Rust. Exhaustive result — NOTHING exceeds the 163 (165 w/ x87-spill num)
ceiling:
- **Op-graph enumeration over {tau,u,lnu,b=u-1,consts}** (Kahan associations, Newton subtractive
  corrections `b−u·(lnu−t)` / `b−b·(lnu−t)/lnu` = 144-145, div-first/mult-first, reciprocal): champion is
  `(u−1)·t/lnu` = **163/234**; independently corroborates agent-M's 128-mask enumeration.
- **Truncated-Taylor / series fast-path** (T2..T5, Horner): all WORSE than Kahan in every |tau| regime
  (best T5=65 on tiny-tau vs Kahan 77). Not a polynomial fast path.
- **x87 per-op double-rounding (spill)** (num/div/tau each RN64→RN53, matching the XNPV spill-loop
  precedent): num-double-rounded = **165/234** (+2), no help on generic (61/90). Not the mechanism.
- **Extended tau → double u** (u=RN53(exp(tau_ext)) from extended log1p, testing 1-ULP boundary shifts of
  u): fixes 0-1, breaks 1-8 — u is robust to the argument's extended tail. Refuted.
- **delta(tau)=em_pinned−CR_expm1 is a NOISY ±1-2 ULP lattice** (roughness ~0.6, sign flips between
  adjacent tau — NOT a smooth monotonic curve). This RULES OUT minimax-rational coefficient recovery (a
  rational's error-vs-CR is smooth). So the residual is a genuine last-bit op-graph effect, not a fittable
  coefficient error.
**Verdict (SUPERSEDED below):** the PMT expm1 |tau|<1 residual is an IRREDUCIBLE ≤1 ULP op-graph wall — Excel's bespoke inline
routine produces a toward-zero-biased ±1 ULP scatter not determined by {tau, exp(tau), ln(u)} or their
extended forms, and not by any polynomial/rational. Tooling: race_x87spill_em, race_tauext_u.

### BREAKTHROUGH — em is NOT a function of tau_double; the argument is EXTENDED (2026-07-23, continued push)
The "irreducible wall" verdict above is SUPERSEDED. A designed **tau_double-collision experiment** cracked the
reason every double op-graph caps at 163: **the argument carries sub-double-ULP information.**
- **Design:** for 7 target tau₀ (doubles in [−0.7,−0.02]), find ~18 (r,n) each with `RN(−n·log1p_CR(r))=tau₀`
  (same double tau) but different exact `−n·ln(1+r)`. Capture PMT (128 consecutive pv each, 16384 probes);
  pin em per config (answers-pmt-collide.json). **em VARIES 1–3 ULP within every group** (pure function of
  tau_double would give ONE em/group).
- **Doubt-probed hard and it HELD:** (a) all 116 pins are UNIQUE (0 ambiguous) — not a pinning artifact;
  (b) the combine is **confirmed SSE2** `RN(RN(pv/em)·r)` — the x87-double-rounded and quotient-extended
  combines reproduce ZERO configs, so the variation is NOT a general-rate combine artifact; under the correct
  SSE2 combine, 7/8 groups still need multiple em.
- **Interpretation:** Excel's financial expm1 keeps `tau` (= −n·log1p(r)) in an **80-bit x87 register, never
  spilled to a 53-bit double**, so em depends on tau's bits 54–64. This is exactly why {tau_double, exp, ln}
  op-graphs cap at 163 — they can't see the extended tail. em weakly tracks exact_tau (corr 0.24) but is
  NON-monotonic in it, and idealized round53(CR64(expm1(round64(exact_tau)))) scores only 72/116 (WORSE than
  53-bit) — so the extended dependence is via Excel's SPECIFIC x87 op-graph (fFEXP/FYL2XP1 with their
  ~1-ext-ULP microcode error, which is r-dependent), NOT idealized round-to-64. My fyl2x/fyl2xp1-based extended
  models get 83/116 (right structure, wrong tail) — the exact internal **log1p delivery + `×n` staging** is the
  remaining unknown. NOTE: "log1p is CR" was proven only for WORKSHEET LN (spilled to double); the financial
  body's internal log1p is evidently kept extended and its 64-bit tail is what matters.
- **This REFRAMES the search from the expm1 correction to the EXTENDED TAU FORMATION**, and gives a sharp
  discriminating oracle (the collision set: 7/8 groups need the exact extended op-graph, not just the plurality).
